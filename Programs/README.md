## 🛰️ Project Journey

### 📌 Stage 1: Selection & Foundation  
- Participated in **Round 1** at **VIT Bhopal University**.  
- Out of **21 given topics**, Team Odyssey chose:  
  **“High-Definition Product of Night Time Light with DL/ML — Data Fusion Between NTL and Optical/SAR Data.”**  
- Developed an architecture for **real-time visualization of nocturnal satellite imagery** across Indian roads.

---

### 📌 Stage 2: National Recognition  
- Emerged as **the sole selected team** under our chosen topic among **56 shortlisted teams** from thousands nationwide.  
- ISRO later **merged topics into domain-specific problem statements** — just **3 days before the final hackathon on January 14, 2024**.  
- Adapted quickly by selecting a new, revised problem statement aligned with the merged domain.

---

### 📌 Stage 3: The Challenge Unfolds  
- With **zero prior knowledge** on the new topic, we dived into:  
  **“Unveiling Interconnected Patterns and Hotspots in Synergized Landscape Dynamics, Economic Growth, and Environmental Data for Informed Decision-Making.”**  
- Tackled this within an intense **30-hour hacking window**.

---

### 📌 Stage 4: Crafting the Solution  
- Developed a **web application** focusing on relational patterns and hotspots involving:
  - **GDP**
  - **Land Use Land Cover (LULC)**
  - **Rainfall (Precipitation)**

- Key features:
  - Used **machine learning models** to identify hidden parameters and establish relationships between LULC and GDP.
  - Integrated atmospheric and geophysical datasets for comprehensive correlation analysis.
  - Generated **spatio-temporal hotspots and trends** from multi-dimensional datasets.
  - Included **anomaly validation** and detailed analytics modules.

---

### 📌 Stage 5: Finale & National Ranking  
- Presented our findings to a panel of **ISRO scientists**.
- Project received strong resonance for its **practical applications and research depth**.
- Team Odyssey secured a place in the **Top 25 teams** nationwide.
- Further recognized among **Top 15 teams**, winning one of the **coveted runner-up positions**.

**Judging Panel included:**
- **Former ISRO Director**
- **Two renowned Geoinformatics scientists**
- **CEO from a leading Geo-Tech startup**
